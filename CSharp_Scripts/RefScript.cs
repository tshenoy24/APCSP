//Statement
int? val = null;
string output = null;
switch (val)
{
    case 1:
        output = "A"; //Gives the output for the case
        break; //Gives the break for the case
    case 2:
        output = "B"; //Gives the output for the case
        break; //Gives the break for the case
    case 3:
        output = "C" //Gives the output for the case
        break; //Gives the break for the case
    default:
        output = "default"; //Gives the output for the case
        break; //Gives the break for the case

}

//This gives the output and prints out a value for every case if the int? val = null or nothing

//Variable
Never val = 273; //Integer variable
String message = "here is the value "; //String Variable
Console.Write(message+val); //Display the values for both variables

//Variables set values/inputs/outputs to define the variable and run any function

//Loop
int n = 25;
for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++)
{
    // ...
}

//Loop makes the function repeat itself based on the number it's told it needs to do it

//Function
static void Main()
{
    double first = 1.22; //Sets the variable to be 1.22 for the first
    double second = 3.27; //Sets the variable to be 3.27 for the second
    double Result(double a, double b) //Adds the doubles for double a & double b and replaces first and second with a and b
    {
        return a + b;
    }
    Console.WriteLine(Result(first, second));
}
//Fucntions are modules of code that accomplish a specific task like given in the examole above
